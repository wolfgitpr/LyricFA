The Mandarin dictionary files in this folder are based on CC-CEDICT, a community-maintained free Chinese-English dictionary. CC-CEDICT is a continuation of the CEDICT project started by Paul Denisowski in 1997. The aim of CC-CEDICT is to provide a complete downloadable Chinese to English dictionary with pronunciation in pinyin for the Chinese characters.
